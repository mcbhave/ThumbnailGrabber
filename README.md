Feel free to use it as is; this REST API is fully functional and designed to generate an image with a YouTube link as a parameter. 
Simply set the slide duration in seconds to capture the desired image. For any questions or additional details, 
don't hesitate to reach out to me at admin@wimsup.com or visit https://wimsup.com. Thank you, and best of luck!
PS: if you host it publically I would love to use it :), compile and host it on a server and let me know.
